# gl-maze-demo

### Overview

Demonstration of applying basic game/environment logic with geometry rendered in OpenGLES.

Generates a random maze at runtime and renders panes to represent each wall in the maze.

Utilizes a Phong shading model to achieve a variety of lighting effects through a [light shader](https://github.com/jake-pauls/gl-maze-demo/blob/main/gl-maze-demo/res/shaders/LightShader.fsh) including a flashlight, day/night, and fog (using a linear calculation for density).
